data = [10, 501, 22, 37, 100, 999, 87, 351]
result = filter(lambda x: x > 4, data)
print(list(result))

Expected output:
[10, 501, 22, 37, 100, 999, 87, 351]

Thus above code checks the each elements in the data list are greater than 4 or not, 
if it is greater than 4 - filter function fetches that element saves in the result variable and 
prints those elements in the form of list.
